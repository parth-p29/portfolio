                            Hey! My name is Parth Patel and I'm an aspiring software engineer who loves building new things for the internet.

                        I grew up in Toronto, Canada and discovered coding at ~14 years old. Ever since then, I enjoy working on interesting projects that can help people around the world.
                        </p>
